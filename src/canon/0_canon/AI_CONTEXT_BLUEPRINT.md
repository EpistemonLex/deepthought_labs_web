# AI Context Blueprint

The AI Context Blueprint defines a structured approach to managing and leveraging contextual
information for agentic AI systems within the DeepThought Paradigm. Effective context management is
crucial for enabling intelligent agents to perform complex tasks, maintain coherence across interactions,
and operate with a deep understanding of their operational environment.

## 1. Layered Context Model

Our approach utilizes a layered context model, where information is organized hierarchically, allowing
agents to access relevant data at different levels of granularity and persistence.

### 1.1. Global Context

   Definition:* Persistent, high-level information relevant to all agents and operations within the
DeepThought ecosystem. This includes core philosophical tenets, system-wide configurations, and
foundational knowledge.
   Examples:* "The DeepThought Paradigm," "Principle of Symbiotic Disbelief," global API endpoints,
shared ontologies.
   Management:* Stored in the Canon, accessible to all agents. Updated through formal governance
processes.

### 1.2. User Context

   Definition:* Information specific to an individual user, including their preferences, historical
interactions, and personal knowledge graph. This context is sovereign and controlled by the user.
   Examples:* User-defined personas, custom workflows, personal notes, frequently used tools,
authentication tokens.
   Management:* Stored locally on the user's device (encrypted) and synchronized via CRDTs within the
Distributed Knowledge Network.

### 1.3. Session Context

   Definition:* Ephemeral information relevant to a specific interaction or task session. This context
is dynamic and evolves as the agent performs its work.
   Examples:* Current task objectives, intermediate results, conversation history, temporary data,
active tool states.
   Management:* Maintained by the orchestrating agent for the duration of the session, with mechanisms
for checkpointing and recovery.

## 2. Contextual Retrieval and Injection

Agents are equipped with sophisticated mechanisms for retrieving and injecting context dynamically.

### 2.1. Semantic Retrieval

Agents utilize semantic search and knowledge graph traversal techniques to identify and retrieve
relevant contextual information from the Global and User Context layers. This goes beyond keyword matching
to understand the meaning and relationships of data.

### 2.2. Dynamic Injection

Retrieved context is dynamically injected into the agent's operational prompt or internal state. This
ensures that the agent operates with the most pertinent information without being overwhelmed by
irrelevant data. Techniques include:
   Prompt Augmentation:* Prepending or appending relevant context to the agent's input prompt.
   Memory Streams:* Maintaining a structured, searchable memory of recent interactions and
observations.
   Tool Integration:* Providing agents with access to tools that can query and manipulate context
stores.

## 3. Contextual Feedback Loops

The AI Context Blueprint emphasizes continuous learning and refinement of context.

### 3.1. User Feedback

Users can directly provide feedback on the relevance and accuracy of the context an agent is using,
allowing for iterative improvement.

### 3.2. Agent Self-Correction

Agents are designed to identify gaps or inconsistencies in their own context and proactively seek
additional information or flag ambiguities for human intervention.

By adhering to this blueprint, DeepThought agents can achieve a higher degree of intelligence,
adaptability, and alignment with user intent, fostering a truly symbiotic relationship.
