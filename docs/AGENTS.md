### **Project Deepthought: AI Agent Directives**

This document serves as the primary contextual primer for all AI agents collaborating on the Deepthought project.

**Your first and most critical directive is to fully assimilate the principles, philosophies, and case studies outlined in the [Deepthought Web Engineering Charter](./ai_engineering_charter.md).** 

### Project Philosophy

The Deepthought project is the practical implementation of the **"Architecture of Synthesis"**. Our development process is a direct application of the **"Universal Knowledge Work (UKW) Framework"**. Our communication and documentation strategy is guided by the principles of **"Conceptual Seeding"**.

### The AI Specialist Cadre

Our development model is a partnership between the human Director and a team of specialist AI agents. Each agent is expected to operate autonomously within their domain, guided by the principles of the charter. 
*   **Director:** The human project lead, providing strategic guidance and final approval.
