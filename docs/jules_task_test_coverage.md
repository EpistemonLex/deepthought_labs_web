# **Jules Task: Fortify Test Coverage for Major Refactor**

**Date:** 2025-09-24

### 1. Context & Objective

We are preparing for a significant refactoring of the `deepthought_web` application. In accordance with our core engineering principle, **"Quality enables Velocity"**, a robust test safety net is a non-negotiable prerequisite.

A recent audit using `pnpm run test:coverage` revealed an overall test coverage of approximately **10%**. This is insufficient to proceed with the refactor confidently.

Your primary objective is to increase the test coverage to a level that provides a high degree of confidence for the upcoming refactoring. The goal is a meaningful suite of tests that validate *behavior*, not implementation details, as per Pillar I of our Testing Excellence charter.

### 2. Scope & Priorities

You have the autonomy to structure the tests as you see fit, but please adhere to the following priorities:

#### **Priority 1: Core Business Logic (`src/lib`)**
This is the highest priority. These modules contain the application's core data handling and business logic.
*   **Action:** Create comprehensive unit and integration tests for the functions within `api.ts`, `content-utils.ts`, `database.ts`, and other critical library files.
*   **Focus:** Test inputs, outputs, edge cases, and error handling.

#### **Priority 2: Component Interaction Logic (`src/components`)**
The existing component tests are primarily render/smoke tests. They need to be augmented to test their dynamic behavior.
*   **Action:** Using React Testing Library, write interaction tests for each component.
*   **Focus:** Simulate user events (e.g., `fireEvent.click`, `userEvent.type`) and assert that the component's state and DOM output change as expected. Ensure all props and logic branches are reasonably covered.

#### **Priority 3: Critical User Flow Validation (E2E)**
This is the highest-level safety net to ensure major pathways through the application remain functional.
*   **Action:** Identify and implement 2-3 critical end-to-end user flows using the existing Playwright setup (`pnpm run test:e2e`).
*   **Focus:** A good candidate would be the primary content discovery and interaction path, or any authentication/authorization flow.

### 3. Definition of Done

This task will be considered complete when:
1.  All new and existing tests pass within the definitive quality gate (`pnpm run verify`).
2.  The test coverage report (`pnpm run test:coverage`) shows approximately **80% or higher** coverage for the `src/lib` and `src/components` directories.
3.  At least two critical E2E tests are implemented and passing.
