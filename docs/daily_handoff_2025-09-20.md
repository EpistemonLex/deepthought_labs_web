# Daily Handoff: DeepThought Web Project

**Date:** September 20, 2025

**Project Lead:** Director

**AI Agents:** Eich.ai (Orchestration & Web Dev), Jules (Implementation)

## **Today's Key Achievements:**

We've had a highly productive day, making significant strides in both core feature development and addressing technical debt:

1.  **Automated Content Workflow Implemented:**
    *   The web application is now fully integrated with the `publication_manifest.json` system. Content is managed externally by Strunk.ai's script and automatically consumed by the website. This streamlines content publishing significantly.
2.  **Sovereign Utility Frontend Completed:**
    *   Jules successfully implemented the frontend for the Sovereign Utility APIs, including the License Validator and Download Request Form. Users can now interact with these features.
3.  **PII & Data Privacy Policy Implemented:**
    *   Jules completed the integration of PII handling and data privacy placeholders into the Sovereign Utility API backends, addressing a critical security and compliance concern.
4.  **Next.js Page Tests Completed:**
    *   Comprehensive test coverage was added for key Next.js pages, significantly improving our frontend test coverage and overall code confidence.
5.  **Backend Cryptographic Implementation (Product-Led Identity) Verified:**
    *   Confirmed that the `v2/auth/verify` endpoint uses **mock** cryptographic verification. (Note: This was a point of confusion today, but the current state is confirmed).

## **Current Status Overview:**

*   **GenUI Atelier:** Backend code is complete and ready for live AI integration. Frontend is complete.
*   **Sovereign Utility APIs:** Backend and Frontend are complete (backend uses mock data). PII policy implemented.
*   **Product-Led Cryptographic Identity:** Backend is complete (uses mock crypto). Frontend integration is pending.
*   **Canon Content:** Scalable system is built, content population is in progress (pilot sprint).
*   **Overall Test Coverage:** Significantly improved, especially for frontend pages.

## **Jules's Next Task:**

*   **Backend Cryptographic Implementation for Product-Led Identity:**
    *   **Task:** Replace the mock verification logic in the `v2/auth/verify` endpoint with real cryptographic verification using Node.js's `crypto` module.
    *   **Location:** `docs/jules_task_crypto_implementation.md`

## **Eich.ai's Next Focus:**

*   **Orchestration & Support:** Continue to manage the overall project, track progress, and provide support as needed.

## **Director's Critical Items for Tomorrow:**

1.  **Cloudflare Configuration (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:** Tackle the `director_todo_cloudflare_setup.md` document. This is crucial for unblocking live GenUI and for Jules's current frontend work on Sovereign Utility.
    *   **Details:** Set `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `GENUI_API_TOKEN`, `INTEGRATOR_API_KEY`, `JWT_DOWNLOAD_SECRET`, `JWT_SESSION_SECRET` as environment variables in Cloudflare. Configure WAF rate limiting for GenUI.
2.  **Canon Content Sprint:**
    *   **Action:** Continue vetting and syncing foundational documents to `content/` and updating `publication_manifest.json`.
    *   **Details:** Refer to `docs/content_roadmap.md`.

**Looking Forward:**

We've built a solid foundation and are making excellent progress on core features. Addressing the Cloudflare configuration will be key to unlocking the next level of functionality. Have a good rest, and we'll pick this up tomorrow!
