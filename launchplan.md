  Subject: Early Preview: DeepThoughtLabs.ai - Your Feedback is Invaluable!

  Hi [Name],

  Exciting news! I've just pushed live an early preview of the DeepThoughtLabs.ai website, and I'd love to
  get your honest input.


  DeepThought is evolving into a persistent AI personal assistant designed to help people like [mention a
  relatable persona, e.g., "small business owners," "educators," "anyone overwhelmed by daily tasks"] manage
   their cognitive load and amplify their unique capabilities.


  This website is our first step in communicating that vision. It's a work in progress, but it showcases
  some of our core ideas and interactive demonstrations.

  Here's the link: [Your Website URL Here]

  As you explore, please keep these questions in mind:


   * Clarity: Is the core message ("cognitive augmentation," "reducing cognitive load") clear and easy to
     understand?
  Your perspective is incredibly valuable as we refine this vision. Don't hold back â€“ all feedback, positive
   or critical, is welcome!

  Thanks,

  [Your Name]
